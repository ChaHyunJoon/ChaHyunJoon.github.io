**Profile**
I'm an engineer who wants to develop the most convenient autonomous system such as Jarvis in Iron Man. So, I've changed my major from chemical engineering to mechanical engineering to learn the basics of optimal control and have domain knowledge in several power systems. To make Further improvement of myself, I'm trying to make a deep dive into Reinforcement Learning and LLM optimization. I hope to create agent that could understand natural language and learn from actions and as a result to become a perfect agent. This might be my first step toward my vision.
